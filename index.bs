Abstract: This specification creates a standardized way of referencing, dereferencing, and fetching digital resources. This includes associating digital resources with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and organizing digital resources into DID-Linked Collections, where each individual resource is identifiable through its own DID URL.
</pre>

1. Introduction {#intro}
=====================

DID-Linked Resources are digital files that can be retrieved and referenced using a persistent and unique DID URL. 

This specification defines common requirements, algorithms including their request formats and response formats, architectural options, and various considerations for how DID-Linked Resources SHOULD act as persistent identifiers for referencing and retrieving digital Resources (such as data schemas, status lists, trust registries, governance documents, or policy definitions). This specification complements the [DID Resolution Specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/), including its patterns and algorithms for DID URL resolution and dereferencing. By using DID URLs which remain conformant with [W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) v1.0 Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and the [DID Resolution Specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-resolution/), existing DID Resolvers will be able to dereference these DID URLs to retrieve the identified resources using the DID URL query syntax in this specification.

_**Note:** While this specification defines some base-level functionality for DID URL dereferencing, the actual steps required to communicate with a DID's verifiable data registry are defined by the applicable DID method specification._

1.1 Conformance {#conformance}
=====================

In addition to sections marked as non-normative, all authoring guidelines, diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.
The key words MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, OPTIONAL, and SHOULD in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3. DID-Linked Resources {#resources}
=====================

3.1 DID-Linked Resources context {#context}
=====================

The [DID Core specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) defines an interoperable standard for DID documents and associated core properties, however it does not currently have a standardized way to specify properties of Resources associated with DIDs, nor how to consistently reference nor retrieve them.

Digital Resources are _generally_ stored on traditional centralized-storage endpoints, but this comes with certain drawbacks:

1. **Digital Resources could be tampered with by compromising the hosting provider**: Digital Resources stored at a centralized web endpoint can be compromised and replaced by malicious actors.
2. **Hosting providers could unilaterally cease to host particular clients**: Hosting providers could terminate accounts due to factors such as non-payment of fees, violation of Terms of Service, etc.
3. **[Single point of failure (SPOF)](https://dbpedia.org/resource/Single_point_of_failure) in resiliency**: Even with highly-trusted and sophisticated hosting providers who may not present a risk of infrastructure being compromised, a service outage at the hosting provider can make a Resource anchored on their systems inaccessible.

Despite these issues, many decentralized identity or Digital Credential implementations, _even ones that use ledgers or other distributed systems for DIDs_, often utilize centralized storage. From the [W3C Verifiable Credential Implementation Guide](https://w3c.github.io/vc-imp-guide/#creating-new-credential-types):

> Example schema.org address with full URLs:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "@type": "http://schema.org/Person",
>   "http://schema.org/address": {
>     "@type": "http://schema.org/PostalAddress",
>     "http://schema.org/streetAddress": "123 Main St.",
>     "http://schema.org/addressLocality": "Blacksburg",
>     "http://schema.org/addressRegion": "VA",
>     "http://schema.org/postalCode": "24060",
>     "http://schema.org/addressCountry": "US"
>   }
> }
> ```

Using traditional web endpoints to store digital resources that are critical for a Verifiable Credential to function, detracts from the proper functioning and utility that persistently-accessible Decentralized Identifiers offer. This has also resulted in inconsistent and unstandardized approaches to storing, referencing, and retrieving digital resources such as schemas, trusted issuer lists and status lists.

3.2 DID-Linked Resources construction {#contruction}
=====================

"Resources" SHOULD be identifiable using a Decentralized Identifier (DID) and a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) that acts as a permanently-accessible identifier to fetch the Resource from a Verifiable Data Registry or other storage endpoint. We refer to this UUID as the "Resource ID".

Using UUIDs ensures a high level of confidence that no two identical Resource IDs will ever be created. This is important for ensuring the integrity and unambiguity of each individual DID-Linked Resource.

The following path-based syntax is an example of how a DID Method may construct a DID URL to point to a DID-Linked Resource:

`did:example:<unique-identifier>/resources/<universally-unique-identifier>`

_**Note:** The above path-based syntax would be an implementation-specific way of referencing a resource._

3.3 DID-Linked Resource Collections {#collections}
=====================

Resources are organized into groups or sets called "Collections". Each DID may have an associated Collection, and the Collection ID is derived from the unique identifier of the DID.

The most important concept used in this design is that each Collection is identified using a DID and is described using a DID document.

The DID document acts as metadata, providing information about the Collection, such as who is able to update it, when it was created, and what are the latest and/or deprecated versions of Resources within the Collection.
For example, the following DID:

`did:example:0a5b94d0-a417-48ed-a6f5-4abc9e95888d`

will derive the Collection ID: `0a5b94d0-a417-48ed-a6f5-4abc9e95888d`

_**Note:** The Collection ID may take the syntactical form of the DID method that the DID-Linked Resource is associated with._

4. DID-Linked Resources Algorithm {#algorithm}
=====================

To create a "DID-Linked Resource", you MUST first create a "parent" DID, from which the Collection ID can be derived, and under which the associated Resources will be linked. 

Next, to create a digital Resource associated with the "parent" DID, you MUST provide the following Request inputs:

1. `resourceId`: Generate a new, unique UUID for the Resource
2. `collectionId`: Specify the Collection ID as the same unique identifier of the parent DID
3. `resourceName`: Provide a name for the Resource of your choice
4. `resourceType`: Specify the type of Resource and make reference to the DID Spec Registries to utilise consistent and registered Resource Types. 
5. `data`: pass the Resource file as a path or Base64 encoded in-line.
5. Sign the transaction using the same Verification Method keys as those within the parent DID Document. 

As a response, the DID Document SHOULD append metadata about the DID-Linked Resource into the existing DID Document Metadata.

      }
    ]
  }
}

5. Linking DIDs to Resources and Collections {#linkage}
=====================

Multiple Resources can be stored within a Collection and linked to the same DID; for example, this could be new versions of the same Resource over a period of time, or entirely different resources. This enables unique resources to be stored directly on a Verifiable Data Registry (VDR) and be retrievable through DID resolution and DID URL dereferencing.

Once you have created a resource, the DID document will automatically reference the resource and the collection within the `didDocumentMetadata` in a newly defined section called `linkedResourceMetadata`.

This relationship is shown in the diagram below:

5.1 Architecture Overview {#archoverview}
=====================

<img src="DID-Linked-Resources-Relationship" alt="DID-Linked Resources Architecture Overview">

4. Design principles {#principles}
=====================

The following design principles should be taken into consideration. DID-Linked Resources SHOULD:

1. Use existing, familiar DID Core Spec patterns where possible
2. Support existing DID Resolvers and principles of DID URL dereferencing
3. Protect against linkrot for long-term retrieval
4. Enable resources to be versioned and organized, with individual
versions being able to be fetched
5. Include semantic linkage between DID documents and associated resources (via
metadata or otherwise)


5. Resource Request Parameters {#request}
=====================

The following list defines which specific parameters are required and are optional for a request to create a resource:

| Parameter                 | Type                                                          | Required?    |

| `"resourceId"`            | A [String](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string), such as a UUID, that uniquely identifies the resource              | Yes    |
| `"resourceName"`          | A [String](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string) that names and identifies a resource. This property, along with the `resourceType` below, can be used to track version changes within a resource              | Yes    |
| `"resourceType"`          | A [String](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#string), such as a UUID, that uniquely identifies the resource              | Yes    |

| `"alsoKnownAs"`           | An [array](https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#array) that describes alternative URIs for the resource                    | No    |

6. Resource Response Parameters {#response}
=====================

The following list defines which specific parameters are required and which are optional for a response, following the creation of a Resource:

| Parameter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`resourceUri`** | A string or a map that conforms to the rules of [RFC3986 URIs](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-uri) which SHOULD directly lead to a location where the resource can be accessed. For example: `did:example:46e2af9a-2ea0-4815-999d-730a6778227c/resources/0f964a80-5d18-4867-83e3-b47f5a756f02`.   |
| **`resourceCollectionId`** | A string that conforms to a method-specific supported unique identifier format. For example, a UUID: `46e2af9a-2ea0-4815-999d-730a6778227c`.  |
| **`resourceId`** | A string that uniquely identifies the resource. For example, a UUID: `0f964a80-5d18-4867-83e3-b47f5a756f02`. |
| **`resourceName`** | A string that uniquely names and identifies a resource. This property, along with the `resourceType` below, can be used to track version changes within a resource. |
| **`resourceType`** | A string that identifies the type of resource. This property, along with the `resourceName` above, can be used to track version changes within a resource. Not to be confused with `mediaType`. |
| **`resourceVersion`** | (Optional) A string that identifies the version of the resource. This property is provided by the client and can be any value. |
| **`alsoKnownAs`** | (Optional) An array that describes alternative URIs for the  resource. |
| **`mediaType`** | A string that identifies the IANA-media type of the resource. |
| **`created`** | A string that identifies the time the resource was created, as an XML date-time. |
| **`updated`** | (Optional) A string that identifies the time the resource was updated, as an XML date-time. |
| **`checksum`** | A string that may be used to prove that the resource has not been tampered with. |
| **`previousVersionId`** | (Optional) A string that identifies the previous version of the resource. |
| **`nextVersionId`** | (Optional) A string that identifies the next version of the resource. |


6.1 Discoverability via DIDDoc Metadata {#discoverability}
=====================

Once a Resource has been created under a Resource Collection, the parent DID document will automatically have an updated `didDocumentMetadata` section, including `linkedResourceMetadata`.

The syntax of the linked Resource metadata is as follows:

```json
"didDocumentMetadata": {
    "created": "2020-12-20T19:17:47Z",
    "updated": "",
    "deactivated": false,
    "versionId": "bdab59b0-66f5-42d3-b809-1829bdcc0408",
    "previousVersion": "",
    "nextVersion": "",
    "linkedResourceMetadata": [
      { // First version of a Resource called PassportSchema
        "resourceURI": "did:example:13d5ad44-9e99-428f-81e9-274458cefddc/resources/44547089-170b-4f5a-bcbc-06e46e0089e4",
        "resourceCollectionId": "13d5ad44-9e99-428f-81e9-274458cefddc", // Common collection ID
        "resourceId": "44547089-170b-4f5a-bcbc-06e46e0089e4", // Old Resource ID and version number
        "resourceName": "PassportSchema", // Resource name must remain the same
        "resourceType": "CL-Schema", // Resource type must remain the same
        "resourceVersion": "1.0.1", // A user-set version
        "mediaType": "application/json",
        "created": "2022-07-19T08:40:00Z",
        "checksum": "7b2022636f6e74656e74223a202274657374206461746122207d0ae3b0c44298", // Old version checksum
        "previousVersionId": "", // empty string, since no previous version
        "nextVersionId": "bb2118f3-5e55-4510-b420-33ef9e1726d2", // Points to next version below
        },
      { // Second version of a Resource called PassportSchema
        "resourceURI": "did:example:13d5ad44-9e99-428f-81e9-274458cefddc/resources/bb2118f3-5e55-4510-b420-33ef9e1726d2",
        "resourceCollectionId": "13d5ad44-9e99-428f-81e9-274458cefddc", // Common collection ID
        "resourceId": "bb2118f3-5e55-4510-b420-33ef9e1726d2", // New Resource ID and version number
        "resourceName": "PassportSchema", // Resource name must remain the same
        "resourceType": "JSONSchema2020", // Resource type must remain the same
        "resourceVersion" "1.0.1" // user-set semantic version control
        "mediaType": "application/json",
        "created": "2022-08-07T08:40:00Z",
        "checksum": "9123dcbb0b42652b0e105956c68d3ca2ff34584f324fa41a29aedd32b883e131", // New version checksum
        "previousVersionId": "44547089-170b-4f5a-bcbc-06e46e0089e4", // Points to previous version above
        "nextVersionId": "0be87654-4a48-4f8e-8789-15ec3589ccdd" // Points to next version. Empty string if no new version
        }
      ]
    }
```

Importantly, we decided not to populate the `didDocumentMetadata` with the actual resource data, but instead, populate what we refer to as a _Resource Preview_ which contains all the metadata about the associated resources.

6.2 Composition of Resource Preview {#preview}
=====================

Resource previews will appear within DID document metadata. These do not include the actual core data of the resource and only reference the metadata:

* Resource Collection ID: (`did:example:...:`) (supplied client-side)\*\*
* Resource ID: UUID ➝ specific to resource, also effectively a version number (supplied client-side)
* Resource Name: String (e.g., `JSONSchema2020` (supplied client-side))
* Resource Type (supplied client-side)
* Resource Version (supplied client-side)
* MediaType: (e.g., `application/json`/`image`/`application/octet-stream`/`text/plain`) (computed VDR-side)
* Created: XMLDatetime (computed VDR-side)
* Checksum: SHA-256 (computed VDR-side)
* previousVersionId: empty string if first, otherwise ID as long as `Name`, `ResourceType`, and `MimeType` match previous version (computed VDR-side)
* nextVersionId: empty string if first/latest, otherwise ID as long as `Name`, `ResourceType`, and `MimeType` match previous version (computed VDR-side)
* Also known as: a list of alternative URIs that can be used to get the resource.

Example:

```json
{
  "resourceUri": "did:example:13d5ad44-9e99-428f-81e9-274458cefddc/resources/bb2118f3-5e55-4510-b420-33ef9e1726d2",
  "resourceCollectionId": "13d5ad44-9e99-428f-81e9-274458cefddc",
  "resourceId": "bb2118f3-5e55-4510-b420-33ef9e1726d2",
  "resourceName": "PassportSchema",
  "resourceType": "CL-SChema",
  "resourceVersion": "1.0.1",
  "mediaType": "application/json",
  "created": "2022-04-20T20:19:19Z",
  "checksum": "a7c369ee9da8b25a2d6e93973fa8ca939b75abb6c39799d879a929ebea1adc0a",
  "previousVersionId": "67f2df00-0b6e-404b-8c70-1d63200e6412",
  "nextVersionId": "98922424-c214-4439-b52c-f68ddb450b40",
  "alsoKnownAs": [{
      "uri": "https://example.com/alternative-uri",
      "description": "Alternative URI description"
      },
      {
      "uri": "https://example.com/alternative-uri",
      "description": "Alternative URI description"
      }]
}
```
7 Resolution and Dereferecing process {#dereferencing}
=====================

This section outlines the process for resolving a DID URL to retrieve the linked resource.

7.1 DID Resolution and Dereferencing

When you resolve a DID you get a DID Document as by DID Core. When you dereference a DID, you may get the DID Document, a portion of a DID document, or the resource at the end of a service endpoint (if the DID contains a service component). You can only resolve a DID to return a DID document, and you can only dereference a DID reference to return a digital resource.

7.2 Resource resolution and dereferencing {#dereferencing}

Normal DID URL dereferencing can be conceived in two steps:

1. A DID is resolved to a DID Document;
2. A resource within / associated with the DID Document is identified, based on the portion of the DID URL that follows the DID (path, query, fragment as defined by the ABNF in section 3.2 of the DID 1.0 specification.).

Requests to fetch Resources are considered as a DID URL Dereferencing scenario it uses [DID URL paths](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#path) to lead to a Resource object, rather than a DIDDoc.

On the other hand, Resources _metadata_ requests are handled like DID URL Resolution since the result is a subsection of `didDocumentMetadata` specific to that resource.

7.3 Resource resolution and dereferencing parameters

Here we have an ability to specify different parameters to filter to particular DID-Linked Resources.

| Parameter              | Type                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

Like with DIDDoc query parameters, these can all be chained together to create complex requests for specific DID-Linked Resources at particular points in time or associated with particular DIDDoc versions.&#x20;

7.4 Rules and logic for handling ambiguous queries

It is important to understand how our resolver logically handles more complex dereferencing requests. We have set some baseline defaults and rules to ensure a logical and consistent experience for clients who use our resolver.

1. **Ambiguity generally throws an error**

If the request specifies a parameter where there are multiple potential results, such as where the DID has two resources of the same `resourceType` ('String') but `resourceName` is not the same,  an error will be thrown because there is not enough information to discern which resource is being requested.

2. **Multiple versions of the same resource**

If there are multiple resources with the same `resourceType` and `resourceName` but with different `versionIds,` and there is no parameter specified to fetch a particular version, **the resolver will fetch the latest resource by default**.

This is because the query is not ambiguous in terms of discerning which set of resources to dereference to, but is only ambiguous in terms of which version of that resource to fetch.&#x20;

3. **Ambiguity + resourceMetadata=true**

If there is an ambiguous query, such as where there are two resources with the same name but different types, AND there is a resourceMetadata=true parameter, resource data pertaining to all the resources which could potentially be seen as being ambiguous will be returned.&#x20;

For example, in the below example, there are multiple resources with the `resourceType= string`, but with different `resourceName` parameters:

8 Resolution and Dereferecing examples {#examples}
=====================

8.1 ResourceId

`ResourceId` parameter can be used for filtering a particular resource version by specifically identifying its unique ID.

**Example**:

<details>

<summary>Request format</summary>

```
1.0/identifiers/did:example:b5d70adf-31ca-4662-aa10-d3a54cd8f06c?resourceId=5e16a3f9-7c6e-4b6b-8e28-20f56780ee25
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Response format</summary>

```
Hello world
```

</details>

8.2 ResourceCollectionId

`resourceCollectionId` parameter filters all the resource by `collectionId` field. By default cause we are asking for resources for a particular DID it already includes all the resource with the same `collectionId` and this parameter can used mostly as sanity check. Without `resourceMetadata=true` parameter will return the latest created resource if there is only one resource or an unambiguous resource.

**Example**:

8.3 ResourceType

This parameter is also just a filter by `Type` field through resources. But there is a corner case if the user asks about exact resource (exact data). If after applying all the parameters in request several resources are left with the same `Name` - the latest one will be responded. Otherwise - error `NotFoundError` will be raised.

8.6 ResourceVersionTime

**Important:** This parameter must always be accompanied by another resource query qualifier.

The main goal here is to get the nearest resource for `resourceVersionTime` value. "Nearest" means that if we are asking for time between `resource1` and `resource2` were created - `resource1` will be returned. In case if requested `resourceVersionTime` is before the first resource created - `NotFoundError` will be returned. The most useful use-case here is checking that some "Credential" (driver's license) was active at `resourceVersionTime` (was not revoked from Revocation Registry for example).

**Example**:

        "name"
    ]
}
```

8.7 Checksum

It just checks that `checksum` is the same as resource's metadata and also can used as a sanity check. For example, if the user knows what is exact checksum then it may be checked before actual downloading.

    ]
}
```

8.8 ResourceMetadata

This parameter a kind of modifier which works in the same manner as [metadata](adr-005-did-resolution-and-did-url-dereferencing.md#metadata) but applies to resources. It allows to get only Metadata information about resource(s) without downloading. Also it changes the flow for `resourceType` and `resourceName` parameters and general meaning of this parameter - just filter. So, here it allows to create a chain of parameters and apply all of them to the resourceCollection and get only interested resource metadata. Possible variants:

* `resourceMetadata=true`
* `resourceMetadata=false`
* Unused
